In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well to coat the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.\n2. Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.\n3. Add the onion and bell peppers to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 5 minutes.\n4. Add the water and bring to a simmer. Return the chicken to the pot and cook until cooked through, about 15 minutes.\n5. Stir in the heavy cream and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes more.\n6. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice or naan.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* For a richer flavor, use full-fat yogurt.\n* If you don't have ginger-garlic paste, you can make your own by blending together equal parts ginger and garlic.\n* You can adjust the amount of chili powder to taste.\n* If you don't have heavy cream, you can use milk instead.\n* Butter chicken is traditionally served with rice or naan."]
